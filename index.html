                      There is no evidence to suggest that EndoPeak is a
                      scam. It's just that people are&nbsp;spreading fake news
                      to attract more clicks and views. The product is made by a
                      reputable company, Maximum Edge Nutrition, and is
                      manufactured in an FDA-approved and GMP-certified
                      facility. EndoPeak is also backed by a 60-day
                      money-back guarantee, which means that you can try it
                      risk-free.<br />

                      The recommended dosage of EndoPeak is to take one
                      full drop/pill of the supplement under your tongue every
                      morning before breakfast. You can also mix the drop/pill with
                      a glass of water or any other liquid and drink it. A
                      single bottle of EndoPeak contains 60 drops/pills of the
                      supplement, which is enough for a month's use.<br />
